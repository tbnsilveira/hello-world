# hello-world
First impressions and information...  
Besides getting acquaintance to the Github structure and functional commands, the purpose of this project is to register the themes I will be working on, therefore bringing a short description of each area and its main projects.  

## Themes of interest:
### Computational Intelligence:
Actually this is the theme of my undergoing doctorate research, in which I look for modelling intelligent agents based on their perception and decision-making tasks. The application of this model is relevant to the topics addressed below. I also have a strong interest in **machine learning** and **data analysis**, which is also part of the computational intelligence field. 

### Signal and Image Processing:  
I have a particular interest on working with *digital signal processing*, mainly through the use of **discrete wavelet transform (DWT)** applied to one-dimensional signals. I also have interest in *digital image processing* with a focus on object segmentation and semantic gap applications, now considering a wide range of techniques.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP):
The natural language is the utmost human characteristics and its processing is still an open-problem in computing. My approach is to understand language through a **neuropsychoanalytic** approach in order to develop algorithms capable of dealing not only with syntax and semantics, but also with pragmatics. My current work is related to **context identification** in natural language text. 

### Telecommunications:
On this theme I have particular interest in **5G** (5th-Generation Wireless System); **Software-Defined Networks (SDN)** and **Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)**. These three technologies are responsible for a paradigm shift from the traditional network topologies to a software defined one, which is mainly based on *resources available and services demanded*. There's no need to mention that computational intelligence becomes and extremely important piece of this work. 

### Research, Development and Innovation:
RD&I are inserted on any of the above subjects. Here it represents my interest on the methodologies and best-practices to develop research in any of the mentioned areas, as well as risk evaluation, research management and roadmapping techniques.
